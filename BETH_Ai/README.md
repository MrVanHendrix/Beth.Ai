What/Who is BETH AI

Bethis was created to help me running my life with my hyperactivity, my most precious gift. It's a Python Module which is able to perform task like Chatbot, Assistant etc. It provides base functionality for any assistant application. This Beth_Ai is built using Tensorflow, Pytorch, Transformers and other opensource libraries and frameworks. Well, you can contribute on this project to make it more powerful.    
    
This project is crated only for those who is having interest in building Virtual Assistant. Generally it took lots of time to write code from scratch to build Virtual Assistant. So, I have build an Library called "Beth_Ai", which gives you easy functionality to build your own Virtual Assistant.
